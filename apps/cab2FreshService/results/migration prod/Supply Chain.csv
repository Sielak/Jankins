We need to find a way which will allow that, each time there’s a line with operation to do, the box value added will be automatically ticked.  This parameter needs to be valid for both manually registration (as today it can happen that CSO forget to tick the box), and of course for Online registration"," With the increase of the digitalization, SO’s will be registered directly by the customers.  If an order contains value added, with this way of registration, there’s no possibility to tick the value Added box so that the picking list will be printed by the normal preparation and operations won’t be done, which means an unsatisfaction from the customer and extra expenses for the return and new expedition",https://hldisplay.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/itdocumentationrepository/EbPnDImCuRFOpsPJ4S6ponQBJShGqPOiAczJ6bseini-0Q?e=B5mowq
OPEN,2021-01-05,Maja Ostrowska ,,HL Display Distribution Center Europe sp zoo,,4.0,,0.0,,,,,We need to be able to measure proper on time delivery for internal suppliers.   OTD is measure as comparison of real delivery date and estimated receipt date but ERD is updated by factories (ICT) or procurer (EDI) and that gives us fake measure. System should keep somehow original promise delivery date.   Now we need to truck each delay in excel what is additional workload and time waste. ,Correctly measure OTD it is keep decision supporting information. Decrease workload due to manual work. ,https://hldisplay.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/itdocumentationrepository/EZOZhOa6tdFPibSzqzFuyGkBCnNMtgANIAdQ7oZtXuoO9A?e=vVZ5eu
