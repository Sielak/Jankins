The intention is to have allocation of available stock to be limited to the PO/MO delivery confirmed date or item replenishment LT if no PO/MO placed. That logic should be aligned also with the new request regarding booking based on dispatch date and not any more based on order row creation date.    In such solution the new booking horizon is defined by PO in status order acknowledged or higher and by MO in status preliminary planed. As soon as there is an open PO or MO in the planning list (which is already confirmed), system should only book the SO row if preparation date is before or equal to incoming PO or MO. All SO rows with preparation date after incoming PO/MO should not be booked and system should unbook them automatically. If there is no PO in the system, the booking horizon remains unchanged and equal to the item replenishment LT ",The change will allow to limit booking horizon and synchronize it with replenishment. It will  decrease the effective stock & increase stock rotation,https://hldisplay.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/itdocumentationrepository/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B88142D56-A667-43FF-A887-05E6420B6C3E%7D&file=M.%20Stasierska%20RFC%20SO%20booking%20rule.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true

Some of items are regularly forecasted by some Sales Units and these Units demand availability for that products in accordance to provided forecasts. Now there is no such solution and HUB purchase products only based on forecasts for group of items with very long LT and very often occurs that SU which do not provides any forecasts use stock built by HUB for particular Sales Units. Due to that fact there is a need to develop solution which will protect available stock and reserve it only for SUs which are allowed to use it. ,https://hldisplay.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/itdocumentationrepository/EfrNa3ULuUdKuxb1jiLJlZsBhn8n5R1X1bWvQaz41UWc8g?e=haCYce
