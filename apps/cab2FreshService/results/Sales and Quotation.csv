It is necessary to have the possibility to import list of orders with required % assigned to sales market from Excel. 2. Now adjustments from program qov are visible only in “New – Sales Process […]” reports. Adjusted Sales Markets should be visible in all reports related to sales like:  Aaro Customer specification 3. Now in QV, despite rows with reassigned sales market there is visible also the line with originally assigned sales market, with added “*”. It is necessary to create the button in QV which would hide the rows with originally assigned sales market, if it is replaced by the data from qov. 4. As a further change we would like to have the possibility to automatically change assigned sales markets on orders from Financial Group “Schwarz Group” and original Sales Market “Germany”.","Clearer and more useful reports in QV, easier data analysis. Reduction of manual work at the closing of the month (this method will enable replacing the manual division of Sales Markets outside the system). It will also eliminate discrepancies between QV and Aaro.",https://hldisplay.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/itdocumentationrepository/ESFhAoeemfJGtNyb5tBuVOoBYDdGbl3oVKYNpWCkUIXtIw?e=HFu3Hl
