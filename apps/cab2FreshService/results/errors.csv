The intention is to have allocation of available stock to be limited to the PO/MO delivery confirmed date or item replenishment LT if no PO/MO placed. That logic should be aligned also with the new request regarding booking based on dispatch date and not any more based on order row creation date.    In such solution the new booking horizon is defined by PO in status order acknowledged or higher and by MO in status preliminary planed. As soon as there is an open PO or MO in the planning list (which is already confirmed), system should only book the SO row if preparation date is before or equal to incoming PO or MO. All SO rows with preparation date after incoming PO/MO should not be booked and system should unbook them automatically.
